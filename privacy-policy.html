			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>
				This Privacy Policy describes how Innovateria
				("we", "us", or "our") operates and provides information about
				the use of the Strangers Talk mobile application ("the App").
				Please note that we do not collect any personal information from
				users.
			</p>

			<h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
			<p>
				We want to make it clear that we do not collect any personal
				information from users. The App does not request or store
				personal data, such as names, email addresses, or any other
				personal identifiers.
			</p>

			<h2>Ads and Third-Party Services</h2>
			<p>
				The App displays general ads from third-party advertising
				networks. These networks may collect general information about
				your device and usage to serve you ads. We do not share any
				personal information with these networks, and they are only
				able to collect general information directly from your device.
			</p>
			<p>
				We may also use third-party services to provide certain features
				in the App, such as analytics or crash reporting. These services
				may collect and analyze general information about your device
				and usage.
			</p>

			<h2>Your Choices</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					You can customize ad preferences: While we only show general
					ads, you may still have the option to customize your ad
					preferences within the App settings or your device settings.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Data Security</h2>
			<p>
				We take reasonable measures to protect the general information
				we collect from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
				destruction. However, no website or app is completely secure.
			</p>

			<h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
			<p>
				We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will
				notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on
				this page.
			</p>

			<h2>Contact Us</h2>
			<p>
				If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please
				contact us at [your email address].
